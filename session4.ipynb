    "   * Your box dimensions become 1-by-1 now (so the non-dimensional box height becomes $h'=1$)\n",
    "   * The non-dimensional temperature will now vary between 0 and 1 (so $T_m'=1$).\n",
    "   * $\\kappa$ vanishes from the advection-diffusion equation (so its non-dimensional value becomes $\\kappa'=1$)\n",
    "   * This will affect the non-dimensional time step and velocity as well\n",
    "   * Because $h$, $T_m$, and $\\kappa$ are all reduced to $1$ in this non-dimensional code, they can be removed entirely, which will simplify/shorten the code.\n",
    "   * Test your code: when plotting the (re-dimensionalised) temperature through (re-dimensionalised) time, the results should be identical to those from your dimensional code.\n",
