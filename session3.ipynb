    "Many geodynamical problems cannot be addressed satisfactorily in 1-D, and require (at least) a 2-D solution method. Today, weâ€™ll set up a code for that. We will apply the 2-D solution method discussed in the lecture on a 1000x1000 km vertical cross section of the top of the mantle, in which around 660 km depth (the interface between upper and lower mantle) a 600 km long (i.e. wide) piece of subducted slab is positioned. A numerical heat diffusion code can be used to examine how this cold slab will thermally equilibrate with its hot surrounding.\n",
