    "# Session 2, Part 1: One-dimensional diffusion\n",
    "Lecture slides for this session can are \n",
    "[here](http://community.dur.ac.uk/jeroen.van-hunen/Subitop/Lecture_session2.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will familiarize ourselves with the case in which with a variable (in this case\n",
    "temperature) that changes its value not only through time, but also with location. The\n",
    "1-D heat diffusion equation is given by  $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}=\\kappa\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial^2T}{\\partial z^2}$, where the partial derivative symbol $\\partial$\n",
    "indicates that in the equation $T$ has derivatives to more than one variable (in this\n",
    "case to time $t$ and depth $z$). A differential equation such as this one is therefore\n",
    "called a partial differential equation (PDE), and, in contrast, the DEs that we saw\n",
    "before (with derivatives to only one variable) are usually referred to as ordinary\n",
    "differential equations, ODEs).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will solve the heat diffusion equation for a situation of a cooling\n",
    "oceanic lithosphere: a hot column of mantle material (with temperature $T=T_m=1350^o$ C)\n",
    "is emplaced at a mid-ocean ridge, where it suddenly will be in contact with cold ocean\n",
    "water. This column will start cooling from above.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.1) Sketch (on paper) this temperature distribution $T$ as a function of depth $z$ for\n",
    "time $t=0$ . This temperature distribution will be a good initial condition for our\n",
    "modelling exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2) Our modelling domain will be the column of mantle material extending to, say, 300\n",
    "km depth. We already have a governing equation (the heat diffusion equation described\n",
    "above) and an initial condition. To obtain a unique solution, we need to provide\n",
    "boundary conditions at the boundaries (i.e. end points) of the one-dimensional domain,\n",
    "e.g. a fixed temperature, that apply at every time step at the ends of our domain. What\n",
    "would be good boundary conditions for the temperature $T$ at $z=0$ and $z=300$ km?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.3) What does the forward-Euler finite difference form of the diffusion equation look\n",
    "like?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.4) We will first work out a timestep calculation by hand. Suppose we have a system, in \n",
    "which the mantle column is described by just 5 grid points (i.e. $i =[0,1,2,3,4]$). \n",
    "At the boundaries ($i=0$ and $i=4$) boundary conditions\n",
    "apply, and at the remaining, interior points, the above finite difference equation\n",
    "applies. Assume the first solution $T_i^0$ to be the initial\n",
    "condition you obtained in 2.1, and furthermore assume $\\kappa =10^{-6} m^2$ s, $\\Delta\n",
    "t=5$ Myr, $\\Delta z =75$ km. \n",
    "  * Add your 5-point initial solution to your sketch.\n",
    "  * Write out (again on paper, not in Python) for each point $i$ the equation that calculates \n",
    "    the temperature at the new time step $T_i^1$, where $i$ refers to the spatial\n",
    "    dimension and the $1$ to the time step. \n",
    "  * Add this first timestep solution to the schematic plot of the initial condition. \n",
    "  * **(If time permits)**, apply a second time step and again add the solution to the plot. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.5) Now copy the the following Python template `heat1d.py` into your Python editor. \n",
    "Read through, and try to understand how the code is set up. Then, add the missing heat \n",
    "diffusion function `oneDdiff`. Run the code, and check how well the numerical solution \n",
    "corresponds to the analytical one:"
