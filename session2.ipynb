    "# Session 2, Part 1: One-dimensional diffusion\n",
    "Lecture slides for this session can are \n",
    "[here](http://community.dur.ac.uk/jeroen.van-hunen/Subitop/Lecture_session2.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will familiarize ourselves with the case in which with a variable (in this case\n",
    "temperature) that changes its value not only through time, but also with location. The\n",
    "1-D heat diffusion equation is given by  $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}=\\kappa\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial^2T}{\\partial z^2}$, where the partial derivative symbol $\\partial$\n",
    "indicates that in the equation $T$ has derivatives to more than one variable (in this\n",
    "case to time $t$ and depth $z$). A differential equation such as this one is therefore\n",
    "called a partial differential equation (PDE), and, in contrast, the DEs that we saw\n",
    "before (with derivatives to only one variable) are usually referred to as Â‘ordinary\n",
    "differential equations, ODEs).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will solve the heat diffusion equation for a situation of a cooling\n",
    "oceanic lithosphere: a hot column of mantle material (with temperature $T=T_m=1350^o$ C)\n",
    "is emplaced at a mid-ocean ridge, where it suddenly will be in contact with cold ocean\n",
    "water. This column will start cooling from above.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.1) Sketch (on paper) this temperature distribution $T$ as a function of depth $z$ for\n",
    "time $t=0$ . This temperature distribution will be a good initial condition for our\n",
    "modelling exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2) Our modelling domain will be the column of mantle material extending to, say, 300\n",
    "km depth. We already have a governing equation (the heat diffusion equation described\n",
    "above) and an initial condition. To obtain a unique solution, we need to provide\n",
    "boundary conditions at the boundaries (i.e. end points) of the one-dimensional domain,\n",
    "e.g. a fixed temperature, that apply at every time step at the ends of our domain. What\n",
    "would be good boundary conditions for the temperature $T$ at $z=0$ and $z=300$ km?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.3) What does the forward-Euler finite difference form of the diffusion equation look\n",
    "like?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.4) We will first work out a timestep calculation by hand. Suppose we have a system, in \n",
    "which the mantle column is described by just 5 grid points (i.e. $i =[0,1,2,3,4]$). \n",
    "At the boundaries ($i=0$ and $i=4$) boundary conditions\n",
    "apply, and at the remaining, interior points, the above finite difference equation\n",
    "applies. Assume the first solution $T_i^0$ to be the initial\n",
    "condition you obtained in 2.1, and furthermore assume $\\kappa =10^{-6} m^2$ s, $\\Delta\n",
    "t=5$ Myr, $\\Delta z =75$ km. \n",
    "  * Add your 5-point initial solution to your sketch.\n",
    "  * Write out (again on paper, not in Python) for each point $i$ the equation that calculates \n",
    "    the temperature at the new time step $T_i^1$, where $i$ refers to the spatial\n",
    "    dimension and the $1$ to the time step. \n",
    "  * Add this first timestep solution to the schematic plot of the initial condition. \n",
    "  * **(If time permits)**, apply a second time step and again add the solution to the plot. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.5) Now copy the the following Python template `heat1d.py` into your Python editor. \n",
    "Read through, and try to understand how the code is set up. Then, add the missing heat \n",
    "diffusion function `oneDdiff`. Run the code, and check how well the numerical solution \n",
    "corresponds to the analytical one:"
